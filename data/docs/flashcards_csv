## Csv format

The csv format of a flashcards deck looks like this:

> "question1","answer1"
  "question2","answer2"
  "question3","answer3"
  ...

Double quotes are escaped by replacing them with 2 double quotes,
and newlines appear raw:

> "question with a "" in it","answer on
  two lines"

This format can be imported into the Anki program.
