## Flashcards

The flashcards applet is used to practise long term memorization
using spaced repetition.

You build a deck of cards (question-answer pairs), then you start an
exam session where you will be shown 1 card after another, and you
have to report whether you answered correctly or not.

This is using the principle of spaced repetition meaning that those
cards you answered incorrectly will appear more often than cards you
answered correctly.

## The Leitner System

The method used in this applet is called the Leitner System.

- Each card belongs to 1 of 6 buckets.
- A correctly answered card is promoted to the next bucket.
- A failed card gets demoted to the first bucket.
- The higher the bucket the less frequently the card appears:

  | bucket 0
  | Appears every session.
  |-
  | bucket 1
  | Appears every 2 sessions.
  |-
  | bucket 2
  | Appears every 4 sessions.
  |-
  | bucket 3
  | Appears every 8 sessions.
  |-
  | bucket 4
  | Appears every 16 sessions.
  |-
  | bucket 5
  | Appears every 32 sessions.
